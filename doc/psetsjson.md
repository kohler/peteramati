Peteramati `psets.json` files
=============================

Peteramati problem sets are configured primarily through JSON files. This
document describes the JSON format.

Location and composition
------------------------

The location of `psets.json` is set in `conf/options.php`:

    $Opt["psetsConfig"] = PATHNAME;

`PATHNAME` is relative to the Peteramati directory.

A `psets.json` file can be merged from several JSON components:

    $Opt["psetsConfig"] = [PATHNAME1, PATHNAME2, ...];

Peteramati will first read PATHNAME1, then PATHNAME2, and so forth, and merge
the resulting JSON objects. In case of key conflicts, later values win. For
example, given these files:

    psets1.json: { "a": "pset1", "b": {"c": "pset1"} }
    psets2.json: { "a": "pset2", "b": {"d": "pset2"} }

a `psetsConfig` option of `["psets1.json", "psets2.json"]` would produce this
result:

    { "a": "pset2", "b": {"c": "pset1", "d": "pset2"} }

You may also use shell wildcards in the PATHNAMEs (`*`, `?`, `[...]`).
Peteramati will read and merge any matching files.

If Peteramati cannot load a required `psets.json` file—either because the file
doesn't exist or is unreadable, or because of a JSON parsing error—it will
refuse to initialize.

Format
------

A `psets.json` configuration is a JSON object defining *problem sets*, plus
other configuration information. Here's a small example:

```json
{
    "1": {
        "psetid": 1,
        "title": "problem set 1",
        "partner": true,
        "grades": {
            "tests": {"max": 70},
            "style": {"max": 10, "is_extra": true}
        },
        "visible": true
    },
    "2": {
        "psetid": 2,
        "title": "problem set 2 (not ready yet)",
        "disabled": true
    },
    "_defaults": {
        "grade_cdf_cutoff": 0.25,
        "handout_repo_url": "git://code.seas.harvard.edu/cs61/cs61-psets.git"
    }
}
```

This defines two problem sets, "1" and "2". The `_defaults` entry defines
entries common to the problem sets.

Problem sets
------------

A problem set defines everything about an assignment: its name and title, its
deadlines, its grade entries, and its run entries.

Problem sets have keys that don't start with underscore, and must contain a
`psetid` entry. The configuration for a problem set is obtained by merging it
with the `_defaults` object, if any.

Some settings are identified as “dates”. Dates are specified either as
integers, which are Unix timestamps (seconds since the epoch), or strings
(like "2014-10-07 00:00 EDT"), which are parsed.

### Identifiers

Each problem set has several identifiers. The `psetid` is used internally; the
others are shown to users in different contexts.

* `psetid`: positive integer **REQUIRED**

    Unique identifier for the problem set. This identifier is stored in the
    database, so you should never change it once you've released a problem set
    (or student work and grades will effectively disappear).

* problem set key: string

    This is the JSON key used to define the problem set. It cannot start with
    an underscore. It may be a numeric string, but if so, it must equal
    `psetid`.

* `urlkey`: string

    This string is the preferred way to identify the problem set in URIs. It
    defaults to the problem set key, but may differ; for example, if the
    problem set key is `pset1`, you might prefer the shorter `1` for URIs,
    since `peteramati/pset/pset1` looks redundant.

### Basics

* `title`: string

    Human-friendly problem set name. This is the name displayed in the
    interface. Defaults to the problem set's JSON key.

* `partner`: boolean

    Set to true if this assignment may be completed in pairs.

* `visible`: boolean or date

    Set to true to make the problem set visible to students. If false or
    absent, the problem set is hidden on the student UI. If a date, then the
    problem set will become visible at that time.

* `disabled`: boolean

    Set to true to hide the problem set from students and TFs. A disabled
    problem set is not present in the UI at all.

* `frozen`: boolean or date

    Set to true to prevent students from changing problem set data
    (repository, preferred commit).

* `anonymous`: boolean

    Set to true to hide student identities from graders.

### Git configuration

* `gitless`: boolean

    Set to true to mark the problem set as “gitless”. Use this for paper
    assignments, tests, etc.

* `gitless_grades`: boolean

    Set to true to store the problem set’s grades independently of the
    student’s git history. Normally, peteramati stores a different grade per
    commit in the student’s history. (This facilitates regrades and can keep
    some grading history.) With `gitless_grades`, grades are stored once per
    student.

* `partner_repo`: string

    If `"same"` (the default), partners should have the same repository. If
    `"different"`, partners should have different repositories.

* `handout_repo_url`: string

    Git URL for handout code.

* `handout_hash`: string

    Commit hash to use for handout code and diffs. If not set, diffs are shown
    relative to derived handout hash (the latest handout hash in the current
    commit’s history).

* `handout_warn_hash`: string

    Warn user if their handout code is before this hash. If not set,
    `handout_hash` is used; if that’s not set, the latest handout commit is
    used.

* `directory`: string

    Subdirectory containing the problem set code. Use this when a user's
    repository contains data from multiple problem sets.

* `test_file`: string

    The name of a file that should be present in the student’s repository (in
    the specified `directory`, if any). Used to detect when a student ignores
    the subdirectory structure.

* `repo_guess_patterns`: array of strings

    These patterns are used to try to guess a student’s repository URL from
    their user name. If given, the array should contain a list of pattern,
    replacement pairs. The pattern is used to match against the student’s user
    name. If it does match, the corresponding replacement is used as a default
    repository URL. For example:

        ["^([_a-zA-Z0-9.]*s)$", "~$1/cs61/$1-cs61-psets",
         "^([_a-zA-Z0-9.]+)$", "~$1/cs61/$1s-cs61-psets"]

### Deadlines

* `deadline`: date

    The time at which the problem set is due.

* `obscure_late_hours`: boolean

    If true, then do not highlight when a commit is past the deadline.

Grades
------

Peteramati collects grades from teachers and displays them to students. The
`grades` setting, which is either a keyed object or an array, defines the
lines in the grading rubric.

### Grade entries

The `grades` setting comprises a collection of entries. Each entry follows
this format.

* `name`: string (REQUIRED but defaults to the key in `grades`)

    The internal name for the grade entry. This name is used in the database,
    so don’t change it after grades are assigned. Every entry for a problem
    set must have a unique name.

* `title`: string

    The name shown for the grade entry.

* `type`: string

    null, `"number"`, `"text"`, `"checkbox"`, `"letter"`, `"select"`, or `"formula"`

* `round`: string

    null, `"none"`, `"up"`, `"down"`, or `"round"`

* `max`: number

    The maximum number of points for this entry.

* `visible`: boolean

    If set explicitly to false, then students cannot see this grade (graders
    can). Defaults to true.

* `max_visible`: boolean

    If set explicitly to false, then students cannot see the value of `max`
    (graders can). Defaults to true.

* `formula`: string

* `student`: boolean

    If true, then students can edit this grade.

* `is_extra`: boolean

    If true, then this is an extra-credit entry.

* `no_total`: boolean

    If true, then this grade is not included in the total.

* `order`: number

    Determines display order. Grade entries are sorted first by
    increasing `order`, and second by the order they appear in
    `psets.json`. Negative `order` entries appear first.

* `collate`: boolean

    If true, then gradesheets allow selecting this grade for many students.

* `landmark`: string, like "FILENAME:LINE" or "FILENAME:LINE1:LINE:LINE2"

    If set, then in diff display, a text box for grade entry will be placed
    underneath line FILENAME:LINE from the handout code.

### More problem set components

These other problem set components relate to grade display.

* `scores_visible`: boolean or date

    Set to true to make grades visible to students. Implies `visible: true`.

* `grade_statistics_visible`: boolean, date, or `"grades"`

    Set to true to make statistics of all grades visible to students, or false
    to hide it. Defaults to `"grades"`, which means visible when grades are
    visible.

* `grade_cdf_cutoff`: number between 0 and 1

    The CDF graph of grades is cut off below this number. The idea is to avoid
    unnecessary student distress. For example, if `grade_cdf_cutoff` is 0.25,
    then students in the bottom quarter of the grade distribution will not be
    shown their exact standing within that quarter.

* `separate_extension_grades`: boolean

    If true, then extension students are shown their performance relative to
    other extension students (as well as all students); for instance, grade
    CDFs will have a separate extension-only line.

Code display
------------

Code display is controlled by the `diffs` problem set setting, which is an
object keyed by regular expression. For example:

```json
"diffs": {
    "README\\.txt": {"full": true, "order": -1},
    "\\.gitignore|check\\.pl": {"collapse": true},
    "out": {"ignore": true}
}
```

This setting says:

* Files named `README.txt` will be displayed in full (not as a diff), before
  other files (files by default have order 0).

* Files named `.gitignore` and `check.pl` are collapsed. This means that diffs
  in these files will not be displayed by default.

* Files and directories named `out` are entirely ignored; they will not appear
  in diffs at all.

Regular expressions must match full filename components, so the `"out"` entry
will not match a file named `"out.txt"`.

Alternately, the `ignore` setting is a shorthand way of specifying files to
ignore; the setting `"ignore": "*.txt"` means the same as

```json
"diffs": {".*\\.txt": {"ignore": true}}
```

Code execution
--------------

Peteramati can run student code in a Linux container and log and display the
results. This is controlled by the `runners` problem set setting, which is a
keyed object of run entries.

Code running requires significant additional configuration; see
[runners.md](runners.md).

### Run entries

A run entry is an object following this format.

* `name`: string (REQUIRED but defaults to the key in `runners`)

    The internal name for the runner. This name is used in the database, so
    don’t change it or information will be lost. Every runner in a problem set
    must have a unique name. The name should consist only of letters, digits,
    and underscores, and must start with a letter.

* `title`: string

    The display title for the runner. Defaults to `name`.

* `output_title`: string

    The display title for the runner’s output. Defaults to “`name` output”.

* `disabled`: boolean

    If true, then the runner is hidden from users.

* `visible`: boolean, date, or `grades`

    If true, then the runner is displayed to, and executable by, students as
    well as teachers. If set to `grades`, then the runner is displayed to
    students iff grades are visible to students.

* `output_visible`: boolean, date, or `grades`

    If true, then the _output_ of the runner is displayed to students. This
    can be set even if the runner itself is not visible.

* `order`: number

    Determines display order. Runners are sorted first by increasing
    `order`, and second by the order they appear in `psets.json`. Negative
    `order` entries appear first.

### Run commands

A runner can optionally run code inside a container on the peteramati host.
This depends on the suid-root `pa-jail` program in the `jail` subdirectory.

* `username`: string

    The username under which the command runs. Defaults to the problem set’s
    `run_username` key, or `jail61user` if that is not set.

* `command`: string

    The command to run.

* `overlay`: string

    Optional tarball to extract over student code. This can be used to, for
    example, replace files with pristine versions or add grading code.

* `timeout`: interval (number or string like `10m` or `20s`)

    Timeout after which the container will shut down. Defaults to 10 minutes.
    If set to ≤0, there is no timeout.

* `idle_timeout`: interval (number or string like `10m` or `20s`)

    Timeout after which the container will shut down if idle (no input or
    output). Defaults to 3 minutes. If set to ≤0, there is no timeout.

* `queue`: string

    Optional run queue. If set, …

* `nconcurrent`: integer

    Optional limit on number of concurrent runners. Requires `queue` to be
    set.

* `transfer_warnings`: boolean or `"grades"`

    If true, then search runner output for text that looks like compiler
    warnings, and display any such warnings in the problem set diffs. If
    `"grades"`, then students can see these warnings when grades are
    visible, even if they cannot see the runner output.

* `transfer_warnings_priority`

* `xterm_js`: boolean

    If true, use `xterm.js` instead of peteramati’s built-in terminal.
